About: Reference Object
==================

A small object that can serve as a common reference point when testing new types of material. This object is a scaled-down copy of my previous cube model. The new matrials used to print this reference object are glow in the dark PLA, thermochromic PLA, soft PLA, Laywoo-D3 (a "wood filament"), and Laybrick (a "stone filament").
